    <p>
    Here are some ideas that I have for MEGA
    <ul>
      <li>Have a file quartermaster: A web database that contains all files used for signs</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Reason: When starting as a technical agent, one of the most difficult tasks was finding the correct setting file for a particular sign.
        If we had a database dedicated to the organization of these files, future employees would integrate much more easily.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Have a psuedo vertical monopoly on LED sineage. Starting with our own LED display editing software/app.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Reason: We can meet the demands of customers easily and in house.</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop new stand out designs of Premier and Alpha models</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Reason:Having a unique design feature will distinguish our sign from our competitors. </li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
